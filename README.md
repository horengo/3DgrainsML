Please, use the second version of the code "3DgrainsMLv2_public" (the first version was the submitted initially). It can be run locally or directly from Google Colab and other environments.

Improvements with respect to the orinigal version include:
- Compatibility with Colab and GDrive and other improvements to increase reproducibility
- Higher and more secure parallelisation
- Improvements in the extraction of measures from 3D models
- Improvements in the evaluation and validation of the models
